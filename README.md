# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

This project served to fulfill the user story which requested a password generator that enables one to generate a random, secure password utilizing various criteria so long as the password is between 8 to 124 characters long, usingg lowercase, uppercase, and special characters, as well as numbers. These days, advancements in technology has enabled incredible connections to be made, but some are advantageous and hack various accounts rather than utilize their skillz for betterment. This is an attempt to combat that. In order to aid in providing more security to innocent people that just want to partake in the connectivity of the interweb, this generator will produce a completely random password, one of infinite possibilities. The randomness acts as a defense, enabling the user to generate a password that does not link to any personal aspects of their lives which could provide possiblity for hacking. Here I learned how to create variables, functions, methods, and loops, as well as control flow and understanding boolean objects.
